# Welcome to DeepSynthBody

## Main objectives of Deepsynthbody is to,

1. overcome the privacy related limitations for medical data by producing open access deep synthetic data.
2. reduce the time-consuming and resource-consuming process of medical data labeling and annotation.
3. find inter-correlations of human body organs (how one organ affect to other organs) and functions and reproduce them to produce a new model for the human body. 

## Additionaly, Deepsynth body works as:

1. a repository for deep generative models used in medicine.
2. a data compression mechanism to keep big medical data sets in a small storage without any privacy concerns and space to save large amounts of the data 

### Install deepsynthbody library:

```python
pip install deepsynthbody 
```

## Generative modles are organized under 11 categories.
